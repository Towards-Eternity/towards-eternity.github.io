# Before getting married, say these 4 powerful Duas

Ya Allah I surrender myself to you. I turn my face to you, and I lean my back on you. You are the One I put my hope in. And you are the One I fear.

Ya Allah, when things get tough, help me find what's right. Help me choose what's the purest.

When the opinions differ, guide me to the path You are pleased with.

Ya Allah, we know marriage is by Your will. Whether it happens or not is in Your hands. Our work and our hearts are entrusted to You. Guide the feelings in our hearts.

Let’s end our dua with this saying of Ali (ra):

Ya Allah, make what’s in my heart good, and make me pleased with what’s good for me. Ameen.
