# No matter what sin you have committed

Allah wants to forgive you. What matters is repenting sincerely. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.” [Sunan Ibn Majah 4250]

But there is one obstacle: Shaytan. He keeps whispering to you and says Allah won't forgive you. But what does Allah say?

“Say, O my servants who have transgressed against themselves, [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.” (Az-Zumar 53)

So what really matters is that even if we fall into the same sin a thousand times, we can still repent a thousand times. If you are still breathing, it means Allah has given you a chance to repent again. The choice is yours. Will you listen to the true, unfailing promise of Allah or the whisperings of Shaytan?
