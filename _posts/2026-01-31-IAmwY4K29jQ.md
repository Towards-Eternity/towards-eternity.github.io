## Introduction

Marriage is a significant milestone in a person's life. It not only unites two individuals but also intertwines their destinies. As we prepare to enter this sacred bond, it is vital to seek divine assistance and guidance. One way to invite blessings and align our intentions is through supplication, or Dua. Here, we will explore four powerful Duas to recite before marriage, allowing us to submit our desires and hopes to Allah.

## Dua of Surrender

The first Dua emphasizes the importance of surrendering ourselves to Allah. It expresses our complete reliance on Him, seeking His guidance in all matters:

> **Ya Allah, I surrender myself to You. I turn my face to You and lean my back on You. You are the One I put my hope in, and You are the One I fear.**

This Dua signifies our acknowledgment that we are not in control of our destinies. It is a reminder that we must place our trust in Allah, who knows what is best for us.

## Seeking Guidance Through Tough Times

In moments of adversity, it is crucial to seek Allah's help to make the right choices. The following part of the Dua focuses on this aspect:

> **Ya Allah, when things get tough, help me find what’s right. Help me choose what’s the purest.**

When faced with difficult decisions, it is essential to remember that Allah is the ultimate guide. This part of the Dua encourages us to seek clarity and purity in our intentions, especially in matters as significant as marriage.

## Request for Allah's Guidance

The next portion speaks to the diversity of opinions and the need for divine guidance in choosing a partner:

> **When opinions differ, guide me to the path You are pleased with.**

As individuals, we often encounter varying perspectives from family, friends, and society regarding our partner choices. This Dua serves as a reminder to seek Allah's guidance to navigate through external influences, ultimately leading us toward His will.

## Trusting Allah’s Plan

Marriage is an important event that occurs by the will of Allah. The next component of the Dua reinforces our reliance on His divine decree:

> **Ya Allah, we know marriage is by Your will. Whether it happens or not is in Your hands. Our work and our hearts are entrusted to You. Guide the feelings in our hearts.**

This part of the Dua explicitly acknowledges our submission to Allah's plan. It highlights the understanding that our efforts are in vain without His blessing, and we entrust our hearts and emotions to Him.

## Closing Invocation

We conclude our Dua with a profound request inspired by the words of Ali (RA):

> **Ya Allah, make what’s in my heart good, and make me pleased with what’s good for me. Ameen.**

This invocation encapsulates the essence of the previous supplications, asking Allah to purify our hearts and help us accept what He has ordained for us. By doing so, we reaffirm our faith in Allah's wisdom and timing.

## Conclusion

As we prepare for the journey of marriage, reciting these Duas can instill a sense of peace and reliance on Allah. They serve as a beautiful reminder of the importance of turning to Him for guidance, support, and clarity. Let us remember that through prayer and submission, we align our hearts with Allah's divine will, seeking what is truly best for our future and our partnership.
