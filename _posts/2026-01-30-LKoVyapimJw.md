## Early Life and Beliefs

Firdaus Wong was born into a Chinese family in Kepong, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Growing up in a predominantly Buddhist culture, he practiced the rituals and customs passed down through generations without ever delving into the scriptures. Like many, he accepted Buddhism at face value as a collection of rituals and moral teachings, primarily about doing good. However, he lacked a deeper understanding of its teachings.

### Questioning the Concept of God

Although Firdaus believed in a supreme being—often referred to as the Jade Emperor in Chinese culture—his understanding of God was limited and largely influenced by local folklore and beliefs in multiple deities. Growing up amidst rituals for ancestor worship, he later began to question this belief system. An important turning point occurred when he was 11 years old, following his grandfather's death.

During traditional funeral rites, he felt confused by the concept of "Hell bank notes"—money supposedly used in the afterlife. This paradox sparked questions about the purpose of life and morality. If good deeds were meant to lead to paradise, what was the point of the offerings needed in hell? He was silenced when he probed further, leaving many doubts lingering in his mind.

## The Journey to Free Thinking

By the age of 18, Firdaus identified as a free thinker. He recognized that while he believed in a higher power, his understanding of God was still ill-defined and not guided by scripture. As a result, he began exploring different lifestyles. He filled his life with parties and nightclubs, seeking fulfillment externally but feeling increasingly empty over time.

At the age of 22, following a personal injury and a move to West Malaysia, Firdaus was forced to confront the meaning of his life. He engaged in conversations with friends who were Muslims, often questioning the nature of God. One significant conversation led to an analogy about the wind—though invisible, its presence can be felt through its impact on the environment. This idea resonated with Firdaus, who found it logical.

## Confronting His Reflective Thoughts

Despite his newfound appreciation for this concept of God, Firdaus still hesitated. He acknowledges that his fear of hell motivated him to learn more about Islam. He called his mother to discuss his intention to embrace the faith but was met with silence followed by a cautious acceptance of his decision. His mother had noticed changes in his life—improvements in his character and responsibility—which became central to their dialogue on faith.

## Embracing Islam

When the time came for him to convert officially, he recited the Shahada, expressing his declaration of faith. He felt a mix of relief and urgency—it was a significant yet simple step. He immediately committed to abstaining from activities forbidden by Islamic law and began learning to pray, fast, and give Zakat (charity). 

### The Role of Knowledge and Dawah

Within a few years of his conversion, Firdaus encountered a teacher who inspired him to engage in Islamic outreach, known as Dawah. This calling propelled him to actively share his faith with others, adopting the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as guiding principles in his life.

During this time, he gathered a library of Islamic texts, immersing himself in the teachings of Islam and developing a strong commitment to sharing his faith with others.

## The Impact of His Conversion on Family

Firdaus's journey did not end with his own acceptance of Islam. He openly shared his experiences with his family, striving to guide them toward the truth he had found. The pivotal moment came when he invited his mother to join him for Umrah (the minor pilgrimage to Makkah). When he told her she could not come unless she converted, she surprisingly responded with a willingness to embrace Islam.

This transition for his mother was profound, as she recognized the positive transformation in him since his conversion. Firdaus shared the sacrifice and struggles of their journey together, culminating in powerful moments of prayer and worship during their pilgrimage.

## Reflections on Buddhism and Islam

Throughout his journey, Firdaus analyzed the similarities and differences between Buddhism and Islam. He emphasized that while Buddhism does teach moral values like compassion and kindness, it lacks a unified concept of God, which he found deeply fulfilling in Islam. 

He pointed out that the Buddhist concepts of Nirvana and Samsara—entailing cycles of suffering and rebirth—contrasted sharply with Islamic teachings of a clear afterlife involving Heaven and Hell. Firdaus questioned the sustainability of such beliefs, asking how beings in lower states (like animals) could escape the cycle of suffering.

## Concluding Insights

Firdaus articulates that true spirituality comes from not only seeking peace but also understanding the principles that define right from wrong. In his view, being a good person isn't sufficient; one must adhere to the authentic teachings of faith that align with divine guidance.

In a message to non-Muslims, particularly those from a Buddhist background, he encourages them to reflect on their beliefs and seek truth, not merely comfort. He challenges them to question their assumptions while advocating for a genuine investigation into the tenets of Islam. 

## Final Thoughts

Firdaus Wong's compelling journey serves as an inspiration for anyone navigating the complexities of faith, identity, and the search for truth. His story is a testament to the transformative power of questioning and understanding belief systems, bridging cultures and religions in the quest for meaning and purpose in life.
