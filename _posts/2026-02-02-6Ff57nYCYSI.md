## The Reality of Death

Tomorrow, you will die. This is not a possibility; it is a reality. Imagine January 1st, 2026, around 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning. You breathe your last breath, and your soul departs from your body. 

### The Aftermath 

At this moment, everyone is crying for you. Your family and friends gather together, feeling the ache of loss. Around 2 PM, they wash your body with care. Your funeral prayer is performed, and your loved ones carry you on their shoulders, honoring your memory. Eventually, they place you in your final resting place, and when they turn back to leave, your home falls into silence.

Your family sits together, reflecting on the memories they shared with you. Phones ring with callers saying, "May Allah have mercy on him." Sadly, this too will come to an end. 

### Life Goes On

A week passes. Your clothes are gathered, and some are donated to those in need. Your possessions are divided among your relatives for the last time. 

Fast forward exactly one year. Your once vibrant social media accounts have been deleted. In casual conversations, people might say, “May Allah rest his soul,” but this fades away with time. 

Now, imagine two hundred years have passed. Your grave is long forgotten. Another person has been buried on top of you. As the years go by, your physical body decomposes and turns to dust. 

### The Truth We Must Accept

Consider this, my brother: it is certain, it is short, and it is temporary. But this reflection is not merely about death itself. It is about the way we live before we return to Allah. What did you do today? What will you present to Allah when the time comes?

- Did you hurt anyone today?
- Did you lie to anyone today?
- What kind of person were you?
- Did you perform Salah?

### The Hope Beyond Forgetfulness

Indeed, this world will ultimately forget you. People will move on, and the memories will fade. They will forget everything, even your name. However, there is one who will never forget you, and that is Allah. You are still alive. You still have time.

### A Call to Action

Return to your Rabb while you still have the chance. Seek forgiveness for your shortcomings. Remember to forgive others as well, for holding onto grudges can weigh heavily on the soul. 

Prepare for death, not with fear but with a heart full of hope and repentance. Live every day with the awareness of its preciousness, and ensure that you are always ready to meet your Creator.
